        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>
          Solar panels, also known as photovoltaic (PV) modules, are innovative devices designed to
          harness sunlight and convert it into electricity. Comprising multiple solar cells made of
          semiconductor materials like silicon, these panels utilize the photovoltaic effect to
          generate electrical current when exposed to sunlight. Each solar cell consists of layers
          with differing electrical charges, creating an electric field that allows the flow of
          electricity. Solar panels play a crucial role in the renewable energy landscape, providing
          a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional energy sources. They
          contribute significantly to reducing carbon emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. The
          energy produced by solar panels can be used for various applications, from powering
          residential homes and commercial buildings to supporting off-grid installations in remote
          areas.The efficiency of solar panels is continually improving, with advancements in
          technology enhancing their performance and affordability. Different types of solar panels,
          such as monocrystalline, polycrystalline, and thin-film, offer varying levels of
          efficiency and cost-effectiveness, allowing consumers to choose based on their specific
          needs and budget.
